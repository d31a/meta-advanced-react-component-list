# meta-advanced-react-component-list

This is a simple React application that displays a list of low calorie desserts. The DessertsList component renders a sorted list of desserts based on their calories using filter(), sort(), and map() functions, and the App component provides the data prop to display the list. The project was created as an exercise for Meta's Advanced React course.
